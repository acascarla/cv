    After my 5th year in Monlau, La Salle just started a Bachelor's degree of
    3 years oriented to multimedia and videogames that would convalidate most
    of already coursed subjects and all the degree was going to last just 2
    years instead of 3 of the original size or 4 of a normal Computer Science
    Degree so I had any doubt, that degree was designed for me.
